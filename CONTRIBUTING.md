### 1. Find an Issue to Work On

The best place to start is our [Issues tab](https://github.com/iyanuashiri/meethub/issues). We've labeled issues that are great for new contributors:

*   `good first issue`: These are small, well-defined tasks that are perfect for getting started.
*   `help wanted`: These are tasks that we'd love the community's help with.

If you see an issue you'd like to work on, leave a comment asking to be assigned to it.

### 3. Make Your Changes

*   **Create a new branch:** It's important to create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. This keeps your `main` branch clean.
    ```bash
    # Example branch names:
    # feature/add-social-sharing-buttons
    # fix/login-page-alignment-bug
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```

*   **Write or update tests:** If you're adding a new feature, please add tests for it. If you're fixing a bug, add a test that proves the bug is fixed.
*   **Run tests and linters:** Before you commit, make sure all tests and quality checks pass.
    ```bash
    # Run tests
    uv run pytest

    # Check for code style issues (if flake8 is configured)
    # uv run flake8 .
    ```

### 4. Submit Your Pull Request

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add social sharing buttons to event detail page"

    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
*   **Open a Pull Request:** Go to your fork on GitHub and click the "Compare & pull request" button.
    *   Make sure you are opening a PR against the `develop` branch of the `iyanuashiri/meethub` repository.

Thank you again for your interest in contributing! We can't wait to see what you build.


### Pull Request Process

If you wish to make suggestions to this project's code, please keep this few considerations in mind before pushing your _Pull Requests_:

* Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
* Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
* This project code is a work in progress, so there is always room for improvement, but there is no need to impoverish the code base quality; have that in mind when submitting your suggestions and _Pull Requests_.
* Until a better release cycle is implemented,the branch _master_ is the most recent, most stable code base.
* Always push your _PR_ to _develop_ branch, any other will not be considered, and giving the case is easy to do, we guess there will be no difficulties with that.
* Any code submitted should have it's own UnitTest added inside the same code structure the project has right now.
* This projects uses Unittest, Coverage, Flake8 and PyLint for testing and static analysis, install them and use them for your development process.
* Before submitting code to the project, run Unittest on the code base.
* Before submitting code to the project, run Flake8 and PyLint (which we are still tuning so beware of false alarms there, if you detect them, feel free to fix it through your _PR_), look at the reports and fix those lines where there is need to.
* Try your best to validate your signature on GitHub, that way your commits will be signed and validated by the platform.
